This Web App will be hosted on Google Cloud using Cloud Run.
It will provide user authentication using Google domain accounts and then interact with a backend API that is also running on Cloud Run.
The backend API will validate requests based on the token received from the authentication process.
The UI will receive requests with JSON payload and respond with JSON.
Always use ES module style JavaScript syntax.
