**Service to Service Authentication with IAM:**

**Pros:**
- **Fine-Grained Control:** IAM allows for very specific permissions to be assigned to service accounts, enabling fine-grained control over what actions users can perform[1][16].
- **Scalability:** IAM can scale well with the number of users and services, as it's designed to manage access at an enterprise level[9].
- **Flexibility:** It supports various authentication methods, including workload identity federation, which can be used for secure authentication from outside Google Cloud[1].

**Cons:**
- **Complexity:** Setting up and managing IAM roles and permissions can be complex, especially when dealing with multiple projects and services[20].
- **Token Management:** Managing ID tokens for service-to-service authentication requires careful handling of token generation, validation, and expiration[1].
- **User Experience:** Users might need to authenticate multiple times if not properly configured, potentially leading to a less seamless experience[16].

**Identity Aware Proxy (IAP):**

**Pros:**
- **Simplified Authentication:** IAP provides a straightforward way to secure access to Cloud Run services with Google's authentication system, reducing the need for custom authentication logic[4][10].
- **Centralized Access Control:** IAP centralizes access control, making it easier to manage who can access what within your organization[15].
- **User Experience:** Users authenticate once, and IAP handles the rest, providing a smoother experience for accessing multiple services[10].

**Cons:**
- **Limited to Google Cloud:** IAP is primarily designed for Google Cloud services, which might limit its use if you need to integrate with external systems or services[12].
- **Authorization Limitations:** While IAP can authenticate users, it does not inherently provide fine-grained authorization based on domain groups. Additional logic would need to be implemented in the application layer[4].
- **Cost:** There might be additional costs associated with using IAP, especially for high-traffic applications[4].

**Decision:**

Given your requirements:

- **If you need fine-grained control over permissions and actions based on domain groups:** IAM would be the better choice. It allows for detailed role-based access control (RBAC) and can be configured to work with external identity providers through workload identity federation[1][16].

- **If you prioritize simplicity in authentication and centralization of access control:** IAP would be more suitable. It simplifies the authentication process for users and integrates well with Google Workspace for domain-based authentication[4][10].

**Recommendation:**

Considering your scenario involves internal users with domain group-based authorization, **Service to Service Authentication with IAM** seems more appropriate. Here's why:

- **Authorization:** You need to control access to different parts of the application based on domain groups, which IAM can handle more effectively[16].
- **Flexibility:** IAM's ability to integrate with external identity providers through workload identity federation could be beneficial if you ever need to expand beyond Google Cloud[1].
- **Scalability:** As your organization grows, IAM's scalability will be advantageous[9].

However, if you decide to go with IAP, you would need to implement additional logic in your application to handle the authorization based on domain groups, which might add complexity to your application layer[4].

**Authentication and Authorization Recommendations for Static Next.js Deployment:**

**Service to Service Authentication with IAM:**

- **Pros:**
  - **Fine-Grained Control:** IAM still provides detailed control over permissions, which is crucial for your domain group-based authorization rules.
  - **Scalability:** IAM can handle the authentication and authorization needs of a static site deployment just as effectively as a dynamic one.
  - **Flexibility:** IAM's ability to integrate with external identity providers remains beneficial.

- **Cons:**
  - **Complexity:** The setup and management of IAM roles and permissions might become slightly more complex due to the static nature of the site, as you'll need to ensure that the static site can interact with IAM correctly.
  - **Token Management:** You'll need to ensure that the static site can handle ID tokens properly, which might require additional logic in your application layer.

**Identity Aware Proxy (IAP):**

- **Pros:**
  - **Simplified Authentication:** IAP can still provide a straightforward authentication mechanism for your static site, reducing the need for custom authentication logic.
  - **Centralized Access Control:** IAP's centralized access control remains advantageous, especially for managing access to static content.

- **Cons:**
  - **Limited to Google Cloud:** IAP's limitation to Google Cloud services remains, which might not be an issue if your static site is hosted on Cloud Storage.
  - **Authorization Limitations:** IAP does not inherently provide fine-grained authorization based on domain groups. You would need to implement additional logic in your application layer to handle this.

**Decision:**

Given your new deployment scenario:

- **If you prioritize simplicity in authentication and centralization of access control:** IAP would still be a good choice. It can handle authentication for your static site, and you can implement domain group-based authorization in your application layer.

- **If you need fine-grained control over permissions and actions based on domain groups:** IAM remains the better choice. Here's why:
  - **Authorization:** IAM can handle the detailed authorization rules based on domain groups, which is crucial for your application.
  - **Flexibility:** IAM's ability to integrate with external identity providers through workload identity federation could be beneficial if you ever need to expand beyond Google Cloud.
  - **Scalability:** As your organization grows, IAM's scalability will be advantageous.

**Recommendation:**

Considering your scenario involves internal users with domain group-based authorization, **Service to Service Authentication with IAM** is still recommended. Here's why:

- **Authorization:** You need to control access to different parts of the application based on domain groups, which IAM can handle more effectively.
