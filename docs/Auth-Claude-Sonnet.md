Let me compare these two approaches for securing your Cloud Run services:

## Service-to-Service Authentication with IAM

**Pros:**
- Provides fine-grained control over service-to-service communication using service accounts[1]
- Works well in any environment, even outside of Google Cloud[1]
- Can be implemented using authentication libraries for seamless integration[1]
- Allows for custom authentication schemes while maintaining secure access to Google Cloud resources[16]

**Cons:**
- Requires more complex implementation and maintenance of authentication logic
- Need to manage service accounts and their permissions carefully
- Must handle token generation and validation manually

## Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)

**Pros:**
- Centralizes access control for all applications[6]
- Directly integrates with Google Workspace domain authentication[4]
- Automatically handles user authentication and provides verified user identity to applications[12]
- Built-in support for Google Workspace groups and permissions[4]

**Cons:**
- Does not protect against activity within a project[12]
- Has some known limitations with Cloud Run services[4]
- May add slight latency due to the proxy layer

## Recommendation

Given your requirements:
1. Need for Google Workspace domain authentication
2. Authorization based on domain groups
3. Different access levels based on group membership

Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) would be the better choice for your use case because:

1. It provides built-in integration with Google Workspace domain authentication and group management[4]
2. Reduces implementation complexity by handling authentication centrally[6]
3. Offers a more standardized approach to securing both the frontend and backend services[10]

To implement this solution:
1. Enable IAP for your Cloud Run services[4]
2. Configure the appropriate OAuth consent screen for your domain
3. Set up IAP policies based on your Google Workspace groups
4. Modify your backend API to read the verified user identity from IAP headers rather than validating tokens manually

This approach will provide a more robust and maintainable security solution while reducing the amount of custom authentication code you need to write and maintain.

Yes, deploying a static Next.js site on Cloud Storage with CDN requires some adjustments to the authentication approach. Here's how it affects the recommendations:

## Static Site Authentication Considerations

Using Cloud Storage with CDN for static hosting introduces these key points:

1. IAP can still be implemented by placing the Cloud Storage static site behind a HTTPS Load Balancer with IAP enabled[13][4]
2. The static site will need client-side authentication handling since there's no server component to manage sessions[14]
3. Authentication state must be managed entirely in the browser, typically using middleware and client-side libraries[14][17]

## Modified Recommendation

For this static site deployment scenario, you should use a combination approach:

1. For the static frontend:
- Use IAP with a Load Balancer in front of Cloud Storage to handle domain authentication
- Implement client-side authentication logic to manage user sessions and group-based access control
- Store authentication tokens securely in browser storage for API calls

2. For the backend API:
- Continue using IAP on the Cloud Run service
- Validate IAP headers from incoming requests
- Implement additional authorization checks based on the user's group membership

This approach maintains security while taking advantage of the cost and performance benefits of static hosting, though it requires more careful client-side authentication handling compared to a server-rendered Next.js application.
