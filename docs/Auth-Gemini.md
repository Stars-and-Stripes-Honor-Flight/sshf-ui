Here's a comparison of using Service to Service Authentication with IAM versus Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) to secure your backend API, considering your specific requirements:

**1. Service to Service Authentication with IAM**

*How it Works:*

*   The UI service account gets permission to invoke the backend service[7].
*   The UI obtains a Google-signed OpenID Connect (OIDC) ID token[7].  The *audience* (`aud`) claim in the token is set to the backend service's URL[7].
*   The UI sends the ID token in the header of the request to the backend[7]. This can be in the `Authorization` or `X-Serverless-Authorization` header[7].
*   The backend verifies the token and authorizes the request based on the user's identity and group membership[7].

*Pros:*

*   **Granular control:**  You can precisely control which services can access other services[7]. You can grant the UI service account the minimum set of permissions required to access the backend API[7].
*   **Flexibility:**  This method works in any environment, even outside of Google Cloud[7].
*   **Standard approach:** Uses industry-standard OIDC ID tokens for authentication[7].
*   **Authentication Libraries:** Google provides authentication libraries to help with acquiring and configuring ID tokens[7].

*Cons:*

*   **Complexity:**  You need to implement the token fetching and verification logic in both the UI and the backend[7].
*   **Overhead:**  Each request requires token exchange and verification, which adds some overhead[7].
*   **Not natively user-aware:** Requires extra steps to map the service account to a specific user and their domain groups.

**2. Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)**

*How it Works:*

*   IAP sits in front of your backend API, intercepting all requests[4][6].
*   Users are authenticated via their Google account before accessing the backend[4][6]. If they don't have browser credentials, they are redirected to a Google Account sign-in[6].
*   IAP enforces access control policies based on user identity and context (e.g., device status, location)[4][6].  You can grant access to the backend API based on Google Groups[6].
*   IAP passes authorized requests to the backend[4].

*Pros:*

*   **Centralized access control:**  IAP provides a single point to manage user access policies for your applications[4][26].
*   **Simplified authentication:**  IAP handles the authentication flow, so you don't need to implement it in your application[4][26].
*   **Secure remote access:**  Enables secure access without a VPN[4][26].
*   **Integration with Google Groups:**  You can easily grant or deny access based on Google Groups[6].
*   **Zero-trust model:** IAP allows access only to users with the correct identity and IAM role[3].

*Cons:*

*   **Less granular control:**  IAP operates at the application level. While you can control *who* accesses the application, it's harder to control *what* they can do within the application based on the authentication[6].
*   **Limited to HTTPS:**  IAP only works with applications accessed via HTTPS[3].
*   **Can't protect all resources:** IAP can't be used to protect backend buckets[10].
*   **Not ideal for service-to-service:** IAP is primarily designed for user authentication, not service-to-service authentication.

**Recommendation**

Given your requirements, **Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)** is likely the better choice. Here's why:

*   **User Authentication:** You need all domain users to authenticate using their Google account, which IAP handles seamlessly[4][6].
*   **Group-Based Authorization:** IAP allows you to grant access based on Google Groups, which aligns with your requirement to control access based on domain groups[6].
*   **Centralized Management:** IAP provides a central place to manage access policies, simplifying administration[4][26].
*   **Reduced Complexity:** IAP handles the authentication flow, reducing the amount of code you need to write and maintain[4][26].

*However, consider these points:*

*   **Authorization Logic:**  You'll still need to implement the logic within your backend API to determine what data to return based on the user's group memberships. IAP handles *authentication* and initial *authorization* (allowing or denying access to the entire backend), but not fine-grained authorization within the API.
*   **IAP Integration:** Ensure IAP integrates well with your Next.js SPA and backend API.  IAP works with App Engine, Cloud Load Balancing, and Compute Engine[6].

In summary, use IAP to handle user authentication and initial authorization based on domain groups. Then, implement the fine-grained authorization logic within your backend API to control data access based on the same group memberships.

If you deploy a static version of your Next.js UI application with Cloud Storage CDN and continue to use Cloud Run for your backend API, here's how the authentication and authorization recommendations change:

**Authentication:**

*   **No Server-Side Authentication:** Because the UI is static, you can't use server-side authentication methods directly within the Next.js application[1].
*   **Client-Side Authentication:** Authentication must happen on the client-side using libraries like `auth0-react` or similar approaches [1, 4]. These libraries handle the user login flow and obtain tokens (likely JWTs) after successful authentication.
*   **Token Storage:** The client-side application will need to securely store the obtained tokens (e.g., in local storage or cookies).
*   **API Calls:** The client-side application will attach the token to the header of every request made to the backend API in Cloud Run.

**Authorization:**

*   **IAP Incompatible with Cloud CDN:** IAP is incompatible with Cloud CDN[24].
*   **Backend API Authorization:** Authorization logic shifts entirely to the backend API in Cloud Run. The API must validate the tokens received from the UI and determine the user's permissions based on their group memberships.
*   **Token Validation:** The backend API needs to validate the authenticity and integrity of the tokens.
*   **Group Membership Retrieval:** The backend API still needs to retrieve group membership information, likely using the Workspace Admin API, to determine the user's authorization level.
*   **CORS Considerations:** Ensure proper CORS configuration to allow requests from your Cloud Storage CDN domain to your Cloud Run backend[25].

**Revised Recommendation:**

Given this architecture, **Service to Service Authentication with IAM is not applicable** because the UI is no longer a service running on Google Cloud. IAP is also not an option because it's incompatible with Cloud CDN[24]. The recommended approach is:

1.  **Client-Side Authentication:** Implement authentication in your Next.js application using a suitable library [1, 4].
2.  **JWT Token Transmission:**  Send the JWT token acquired during authentication in the header of every request to the backend[4].
3.  **Backend Authorization:** Implement authorization logic in your Cloud Run backend API to:
    *   Validate the JWT token.
    *   Extract the user's identity from the token.
    *   Retrieve the user's group memberships (if not already in the token).
    *   Determine the appropriate data and actions the user is authorized to access[8].
4.  **IAM for Cloud Run:** Use IAM to control access to the Cloud Run service itself, ensuring only authenticated requests (with valid tokens) can invoke the service[24].

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Static Content Security:** Understand that while you're "protecting" the API, the static content itself served by Cloud Storage CDN isn't protected by authentication [5, 6]. You're relying on the API to only serve data to authorized users. If you have truly sensitive static content, this approach might not be suitable.
*   **CDN Caching:** Be mindful of caching. Ensure that the CDN doesn't cache personalized data. Configure appropriate `Cache-Control` headers to prevent caching of API responses containing sensitive information[19].
*   **Security Rules:**  Consider using Cloud Armor to set security policies for the load balancer[2].

In essence, moving to a static front-end simplifies the deployment but shifts the complexity of authorization entirely to the backend API. You are responsible for ensuring that your API properly validates the token and enforces authorization rules based on the user's identity and group memberships.
